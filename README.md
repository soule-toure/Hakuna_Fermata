## Description

Soulful Serenity takes listeners on a journey where the sounds bring them to natual environments, but are also accompanied by traditional piano sounds.
The Track first has listeners in a rainy environment, which eventually through the transition gives an effect of the rain clearing and the birds coming out. This could also potentially hint at the sun being out causing the listener to feel serene. 
The track can take one of two routes depending on the conditional that is fulfilled. 
In one version we begin with the major_pentatonic with 3 octaves, or the minor_pentatonic with two octaves. This adds some variation as we are not in the rainy birds area and with the environment being more alive and dynamic, I wanted the music to be as well.
